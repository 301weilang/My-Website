			<h1>Introduction essay</h1>
			<p>As a rhetor I have indicated great strengths that were made possible through studying a course in WRITING 39B SEM F: CRIT READING & RHET (33055). I have improved in rhetoric analysis by building on arguments by linking primary and secondary sources. The rhetoric analysis I did for the course was on a book by Ted Chiang known as ‘understand’. The primary sources that I used for the rhetorical analysis will be shown later in this document. But first let us take time and know the process of conducting an effective rhetorical analysis.</p>
			<p>You need to first have a topic sentence that determines the way that each point of your essay will be written. After developing more than one topic sentences then you need to state the evidence from the primary source and from the secondary source. This will make the paragraph have a transition that builds up to the thesis statement. After writing more than one topic sentence then the next item is to decode a thesis statement from the written topic sentences. By this stage the argument of the essay is already shaping up so what you need to do is to join all this parts in one essay. The essay should be established on the written topic sentences with each topic sentence carrying its own paragraph. </p>
			<p>All this lessons have been enabled through constant determination and sheer hard work. Writing a strong thesis statement was not easy for me but I reviewed a PowerPoint on building strong thesis statement. This is what made my writing become so easy and right now I can develop very good essays that are thesis developed. I would also urge you to trust the process of hard work and commitment and finally it produces good results. Writing a good thesis statement is not all about writing sentences or arranging ideas in chronological order. It is a logical sequence of ideas that make a reader develop a feel of what a writer is talking about.</p>
			<p>Here are some things that I learnt as far as writing a good thesis statement is concerned: Very specific. It’s not enough that you say imagery is being used. You’ll want to say what kind of imagery is being used. Has a logical flow and not a list. Explains the how of its being done and also the why. Typically has multiple sentences and will be half or more of your intro.</p>
			<p>Although you might find it a huge struggle to combine all these aspects of a good thesis statement in one, a good thesis statement is worth the effort. You could face a challenge close to mine of rushing to write a thesis statement. Please do not be tempted to rushing to write a good thesis statement. Taking time before concluding on the best statement to use for a thesis challenges many people including myself. However the effort is always very well rewarding and makes it easier for the reader to follow through the essay with ease.</p>
			<h1>A copy of my final RA draft with work cited</h1>
			<p>In a normal science fiction story you would expect that the author uses very strong technical terms to establish the plot of the story. This is however not the case with Ted Chiang who cleverly infuses both simple language and scientific terms to writing the novel understand. Understand is one of the short stories from the book ‘story of our lives and others’. Although the book has not brought him as much attention as other stories such as the story of our lives: a story that has been adapted to a film named arrival. Still, the story is very captivating and ought to get the same success as other stories in the novel. The success should be because Ted Chiang’s infuse hard science with simple storytelling in the story ‘understand’. The story is established in a setting of a science fiction. Regardless, Chiang does not use technical terms. There are a few psychological and mathematical concepts but the story is simple and easily understood</p>
			<p>The ‘understand’ by Ted Chiang is an example of masterful utilization of rhetoric and literary devices to convey a tale of human limitlessness. Chiang applies novums and dictions in the passages of his story achieving a good feeling of the whole story. Chiang uses simple descriptive language that the reader understands to talk about a complex biological concept. “This is a story seeped in science fiction, yet the reader does not feel alienated at any point since the author has refrained from using overtly technical terms” (Blake). To prove that the story is a master utilization of rhetoric and literary devices here is a look at one of the sentences in the story: “I wake up, screaming. My heart’s going like a jackhammer. Christ. I pull off my blankets and sit on the edge of the bed” (Chiang pp.1) Here Chiang uses a simple figure of speech where he compares his heart’s pounding to jackhammer using “like” indicating that this is a simile. Despite the sci-fi ‘understand’ by Chiang having very technical terms in it, it still has a simple appeal that makes it to understand. Besides, these simple use of words makes the laws of Physics, easy to understand.</p>
			<p>Ted uses first person perspective in the narration in most of the story that makes the author develop an emotional appeal with the reader and makes the story engaging. The story is told from the narrator’s point of view. There is a certain aspect of the first person narration that makes it easy for the narrator to tell some aspects of his life in a way that captivates the reader. When a personal tale is told by somebody else, it loses some sense of belonging. At the end of the day there are some minor details about personal life that are missed. So in the end telling a story about a person’s life from his own view means that every detail will be told. It is this small details that make the story very captivating. John Blake finds the story captivating and engaging which could be attributed to use of rhetorical techniques in addition to diction of the science subject. “I’ve reached the limits of conventional languages, and now they frustrate my attempts to progress further” (Chiang pp.58). This is just but a single instance where the story is told in first person narration. Chiang is implying that Greco who is the protagonist of the story ought to serve as a subject of research in the military science. This will only limit his new abilities and skills and Greco wants none of this so he devices a plot to escape.</p>
			<p>‘Understand’ shows how human beings have their knowledge limited by nature making it engaging. So many people in the contemporary world are cocooned by their minds. They have dreams and ambitions in life but they do not fulfill most of these dreams. It is because their minds are limited in ability. Greco the novel’s protagonist luckily survives a serious accident and in an attempt by the doctors to save his life, he becomes a limitless human. This weaving of biological concepts with real life examples is what contributes to the novel’s rhetorical mastery. Ted easily weaves the plot of the novel with words that captivate the reader. According to Blake one of the critics of the novel freedom is something that many people desire. According to (Blake) the story becomes captivating since it engages the audience. The reader tends to ask what he/she would do if he had a super power. Evidence (quotes from my story) in page 45 shows how “Getting into the FDA’s private database was easy” (Chiang 45). How do you access the database of an organization such as FDA? I mean, it must take a real smart computer hacker to pull out such a move. The possibilities of what a super brain can do is limitless. The first thought that would come in my mind is to clear any police record that I have had. Then hack into a stock broking company and transfer billions of money into my account. This are the thoughts that cross my mind as I read through the text which captivate me.</p>
			<p>Another literary style that Chiang applies throughout his novel is use of repetition. There are some phrases and incidences that are repeated in the whole story. Most of the repeated passages are important to the plot of the story. No wonder Chiang repeats them to develop his plot in exploring the limitless capabilities of a human brain. He comes up with very captivating scenes that capture the attention of the reader. The illustrations used show that the possibilities are indeed realizable. Chiang’s use of repetition keeps the reader glued to the last full stop. Chiang uses a lot of repetition in the story ‘understand’. An Evidence/ quotes from the story is: “The same nightmare, again and again” (Chiang 37). Repetition is a figure of speech that adds glamour to the story. Chiang infuses this figure of speech with other scientific/technical terms to come up with a nice plot of a story. When the narrator experiences nightmares, it is medical attention that he wants. He wonders whether the nightmares are after effects of the medication. He goes to see the doctor, the way that Ted explains all these events describes a nice infusion of technical terms with simple figures of speech making the narrative captivating.</p>
			<p>According to (Rothman) “In Understand, the protagonist knits together the vocabularies of science and art, memory and prediction, literature and math, physics and emotion. He’s searching a cognitive language in which he can think the kinds of thoughts he wants.”  So when the antagonist is introduced, the story reaches a climax because the conflict has become substantial. It happens that there was another study subject who had been given the same medication as the novel’s protagonist. However the conflict between the antagonist and the protagonist is that they all want to use their skills differently. As for the protagonist he wants to develop a language for himself where he can live a life of his own far away from the normal people. The antagonist on the other hand wants to use his skills to save the world from corruption and other evils in the world. Greco, the novel protagonist finds this is a threat. Besides Reynold the novels antagonist has already costed Greco losses in his investments. He does not take it lightly so he searches for Reynold in an attempt to control him to have the same mind as his own. However Reynold, would have none of it. All that he wants Reynold to do is to show no interest in the affairs of the external world. But Reynold wants to use his gift in a contrasting manner so when they meet they both exchange somatic expressions among each other. Trying to learn the skills of each other, but this will only end up in the death of one of them. Unluckily the person who does not make it is Reynold, the speed and accuracy of Greco are a bit stronger to his own.</p>
			<p>In conclusion Chiang applies an array of rhetorical techniques to make his narrative captivating. These rhetorical techniques include: use of simple descriptive language, use of first person narration in the story, showing the possibilities of a limitless human brain, repetition and use of a protagonist and antagonist conflict. These array of rhetorical techniques are carefully woven with scientific technical terms achieving the sci-fi nature that Ted uses as his writing style. The general feel of the novel is science fiction one because of the choice of words and second because of the plot of the story. A person who however lacks the understanding of scientific terms cannot be alienated from reading the book anyway. This is because the author still chooses to infuse some simple English words and figures of speech. This brings out the feel of a normal telenovela story that most of the readers are accustomed to.</p>
